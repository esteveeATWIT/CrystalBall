Give the appropriate names for each column in this game log from retro sheet. The columns should be this in order:

Using this database, create a spreadsheet with these statistics for every game:
- The date of the game
- The Home and Away Team
- The Home Team's run scored
- The Away Team's runs scored
- Whether the home team won or lost
- Each Team's Games Played before current game (How many games team x has played before the current game)
- Each Team's Wins before current game
- Each Team's Runs Scored before current game
- Each Team's Runs Allowed before current game
- Each Team's Hits before current game
- Each Team's At Bats before current game
- Each Team's Sac Flies before current game
- Each Team's Singles before current game
- Each Team's Doubles before current game
- Each Team's Triples before current game
- Each Team's Home Runs before current game
- Each Team's Hits Allowed before current game
- Each Team's Walks Allowed before current game
- Each Team's Earned Runs before current game
- Each Team's Innings Pitched before current game (for the sake of having data, just do games played multiplied by 9 for this)

In order to calculate these correctly, you need to keep track of how many games a team has played, and start at 0 for each teams statistics. The games are in chronilogical order, so for example, on row 36, that is the 3rd time MIL has appeared, so they've only played 2 games up to that point, therefore games played for them should be 2.

Now, using this spreadsheet, create a spreadsheet with the following statistics:
- The date of the game (20231001 = 10/01/2023)
- The Home and Away Team
- The Home Team's run scored
- The Away Team's runs scored
- Whether the home team won or lost
- The ERA of the Visiting Team before the game was played
- The WHIP of the Visiting Team before the game was played
- The SLG of the Home Team before the game was played
- The OBP of the Home Team beore the game was played
- The Pythagorean Winning Percentage of the Home Team before the game was played

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Add the log5 win probability of the home team before the game was played to the spreadsheet. The formula is as follows:

Let x = home team win percentage and y = away team win percentage
Log5 = (x-(x*y))/(x+y-(2*x*y))
